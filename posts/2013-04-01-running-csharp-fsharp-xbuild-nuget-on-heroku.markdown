description: "Setting up Nancy on F# to run via xbuild"
---

Recently I decided to try and get [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) up and running on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), heres a brief gist of things I did to get it up and working.

## The buildpack
There are [a](https://github.com/bvanderveen/heroku-mono-buildpack) [few](https://github.com/brandur/heroku-buildpack-mono) [buildpacks](https://github.com/BenHall/heroku-buildpack-mono) for mono2.x around on the internet but I was aiming for Mono 3 this turned out to be the longest part of the whole process.

I tried to use [vulcan](https://github.com/heroku/vulcan) to create a buildpack but kept hitting issues so ended up `heroku run bash`'ing, building Mono 3 and netcat'ing it over, its available [here](https://github.com/aktowns/mono3-buildpack). I ended up throwing [Nuget](http://nuget.org/) in there too. Heroku have some pretty good documentation on the process [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api). My compile script is pretty hacked together but seems to be holding up fine.

To use the build pack, pass it in with `heroku create` on a project

    [linenums=false]
    heroku create projname --buildpack https://github.com/aktowns/mono3-buildpack.git

The buildpack looks for a solution file (.sln) in the root directory, and if it detects a packages.config it will run Nuget and attempt to install the packages to packages/ this syncs up with the way [monodevelop nuget addin](https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-nuget-addin) stores downloaded packages.


**The .gitignore file**

When committing files to the repo, I used the following .gitignore to not push up compiled binaries or packages as the buildpack should manage all of that.

    [linenums=false]
    projdir/bin
    projdir/obj
    packages/*
    *.userprefs

## Nancy
[Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) inspired framework for building web applications. Getting nancy setup with F# was pretty straight forward, the only issue initially was finding the right host to bind to, until i discovered binding to localhost allows connections intended for any host *(from the HTTP Host: header)*. 

Make sure to include Nancy and Nancy.Hosting.Self using monodevelop-nuget-addin.

    [name=viewfiles.fsx]
    module viewfiles.Main

    open System
    open Nancy.Hosting

    type DemoApp () =
        inherit NancyModule()
        do
            let Get = base.Get
            Get.["/"] <- fun parameters -> "Hello from F#/Nancy on Heroku!" :> obj

    [<EntryPoint>]
    let main args = 
        let env_port = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PORT")
        let port = if env_port = null then "1234" else env_port
        
        let nancy_host = new Nancy.Hosting.Self.NancyHost(new Uri("http://localhost:" + port))
        nancy_host.Start()
        while true do Console.ReadLine() |> ignore
        0

**The Procfile**

The procfile tells heroku how to launch your application, in the case of self-hosted nancy the following works fine with the buildpack above.

    [linenums=false]
    web: mono appdir/bin/Debug/app.exe

## Compiling and deploying
I had to enable build with xbuild in [xamarin studio](http://xamarin.com/studio)

![xamarin studio](/content/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-01%20at%2010.30.26%20AM2.png) 

and edit the .fsproj to re-order the build order, so `Program.fs` sits last (or your file with the entrypoint) 

![re-order](/content/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-01%20at%2010.40.25%20AM2.png)

`git commit` your changes and push to heroku `git push heroku` 

This takes a while, as it needs to pull down the Mono environment from S3 (100mb), pull down Nuget and pull in Nugets dependencies im sure theres ways to speed this up with caching but have yet to try any of them out.

All in all, im pretty impressed so far with the performance on heroku, mind you i'm really not doing anything intensive and really have a lot more to learn with Nancy. 

Hope this helps wayward travellers, attempting to accomplish similar!
