Recently i decided to try and get [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) up and running on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), heres a brief gist of things i did to get it up and working.

### The buildpack
There are [a](https://github.com/bvanderveen/heroku-mono-buildpack) [few](https://github.com/brandur/heroku-buildpack-mono) [buildpacks](https://github.com/BenHall/heroku-buildpack-mono) for mono2.x around on the internet but I was aiming for mono3 this turned out to be the longest part.
I ended up trying to use [vulcan](https://github.com/heroku/vulcan) to create a buildpack but kept hitting issues so ended up `heroku run bash`'ing and building mono3 and netcatting it over, its available [here](https://github.com/aktowns/mono3-buildpack). I ended up throwing [Nuget](http://nuget.org/) in there too.

To use the build pack, pass it in with `heroku create` on a project

    heroku create projname --buildpack https://github.com/aktowns/mono3-buildpack.git

The buildpack looks for a solution file (.sln) in root directory, and if it detects any packages.config's it will run Nuget on them and attempt to install them to packages/ this syncs up with the way [monodevelop nuget addin](https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-nuget-addin) stores files.

### Nancy
[Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) inspired framework for building web applications. Getting nancy setup with f# was pretty straight forward, the only issue initially was finding the right host to bind to, until i discovered binding to localhost allows all hosts. Make sure to include Nancy and Nancy.Hosting.Self using monodevelop-nuget-addin.

{%highlight fsharp linenos %}
module viewfiles.Main

open System
open Nancy.Hosting

type DemoApp () =
    inherit NancyModule()
    do
        let Get = base.Get
        Get.["/"] <- fun parameters -> "Hello from F#/Nancy on Heroku!" :> obj

[<EntryPoint>]
let main args = 
    let env_port = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PORT")
    let port = if env_port = null then "1234" else env_port
    
    let nancy_host = new Nancy.Hosting.Self.NancyHost(new Uri("http://localhost:" + port));
    nancy_host.Start()
    
    while true do Console.ReadLine() |> ignore
    nancy_host.Stop()
    0
{% endhighlight %}

#### The Procfile
The procfile tells heroku how to launch your application, in the case of self-hosted nancy the following works fine with the buildpack above.

    web: mono appdir/bin/Debug/app.exe

### Compiling and deploying
I had to enable build with xbuild in [xamarin studio](http://xamarin.com/studio)

![xamarin studio](/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-01%20at%2010.30.26%20AM2.png) 

and re-order the fsproj build order, so `Program.fs` sits last (or your file with the entrypoint) 

![re-order](/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-01%20at%2010.40.25%20AM2.png)

`git commit` your changes and push to heroku `git push heroku`
